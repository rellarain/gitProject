            <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
            <p>The self defined by preferences of beauty is the aesthetic self. This self has been neglected in contemporary psychology, which the AURA Program would like to change.</p>
            <h2>A0: Creativity</h2>
            <p>Creativity is one's ability to manipulate, create, and alter ideas. The results from this kind of testing can be helpful for educators, employers, and artists who want to understand the creative talents of their teams, students, and their self.</p>
            <h2>A1: Expression</h2>
            <p>Expression is defined by the methods of artistic demonstration that one chooses to practice. The results from this kind of testing can be useful for art teachers, recreational therapists, and parents who want to understand the artforms that their students, clients, or children want to do most.</p>
            <h2>A2: Appreciation</h2>
            <p>Appreciation is defined by the elements that increase one's enjoyment, or sense of significance, from a piece of artwork. The results from this kind of testing can be helpful for people who want to commission artwork from others. This can also be helpful for individuals who want to have language to describe what they do and don't like in art.</p>
            <h2>A3: Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Interpretation is defined by the information sources you seek when finding meaning in a piece of art. The results of this kind of assessment can be helpful for individuals who want to reflect on patterns of how they understand art.</p>

            <p></p>
